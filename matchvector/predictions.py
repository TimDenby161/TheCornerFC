"""Projected scores and win/draw/loss chances for upcoming fixtures.

Based on the Club Ranking sheet's RG tabs, improved by backtesting 51,000 matches (2024-26):

    exp_diff   = (home_rank - away_rank + HOME_ADVANTAGE_POINTS) / 100   (as in ranking.py)
    base_home  = mean(home team's avg goals scored at home, away team's avg conceded away)
    base_away  = mean(away team's avg goals scored away, home team's avg conceded at home)
                 each average covers the last 12 months, shrunk toward the league average
                 by SHRINK_GAMES so teams with few games aren't extreme
    buff       = (exp_diff - (base_home - base_away)) / 2     (the sheet's "Buff")
    home_xg    = base_home + buff;  away_xg = base_away - buff (so the margin = exp_diff)
    P(score)   = Poisson(home_xg) x Poisson(away_xg), 0-10 goals each
    draw       = P(draw) x DRAW_INFLATION, win/loss rescaled to fill the rest

The sheet averaged this with a "36% x strength ratio" rule; that made predictions worse, so
it's dropped. Log loss: sheet method 1.016, this 1.005 (base-rate guessing ~1.07).
